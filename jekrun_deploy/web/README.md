# What is this?

We will show various methods how the Jekejeke Prolog runtime can
be practically deployed. As a running example, we will use a dynamic
table query. In this folder we have collected the deployment web tutorial examples.

# Deployment Web Methods

We provide the following tutorial examples:
- [Example 1](example01):
  The application consists of a servlet “Plain”.
- [Example 2](example02):
  The application consists of a Java server page “form”.
- [Example 3](example03):
  The application consists of a Java server page “shared”.
- [Example 4](example04):
