# What is this?

We will show various methods how the Jekejeke Prolog runtime can
be practically deployed. As a running example, we will use a dynamic
table query. In this folder we have collected the Swing tutorial examples.

# Deployment Methods

We provide the following tutorial examples:
- [example01](http://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/blob/master/jekrun/deployweb/example01/):
  The application consists of a servlet "Plain"".
- [example02](http://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/blob/master/jekrun/deployweb/example02/):
  The application consists of a Java server page "form"".
- [example03](http://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/blob/master/jekrun/deployweb/example03/):
  The application consists of a Java server page "shared"".
