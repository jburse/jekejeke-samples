# What is this?

We will show various methods how the Jekejeke Prolog runtime can
be practically deployed. As a running example, we will use a dynamic
table query. In this folder we have collected the Android tutorial examples.

# Android Deployment

We provide the following tutorial examples:
- [example01](http://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/blob/master/jekrun/deployandroid/src/example01/):
  The application consists of a graphical user interface for a mobile device.
- [example02](http://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/blob/master/jekrun/deployandroid/src/example01/):
  The application consists of a graphical user interface for a TV device.
