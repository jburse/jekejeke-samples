# What is this?

We will show various methods how the Jekejeke Prolog runtime can
be practically deployed. As a running example, we will use a dynamic
table query. In this folder we have collected the Swing tutorial examples.

# Deployment Methods

We provide the following tutorial examples:
- [Example 1](example01):
  The application consists of a static main method.
- [Example 2](example02):
  The application consists of a Swing frame.
- [Example 3](example03):
   The application consists of a graphical user interface that communicates with a JDBC database.
