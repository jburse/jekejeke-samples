# What is this?

We will show various methods how the Jekejeke Prolog runtime can
be practically deployed. As a running example, we will use a dynamic
table query. In this folder we have collected the Swing tutorial examples.

# Swing Deployment

We provide the following tutorial examples:
- [example01](http://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/blob/master/jekrun/deployment/example01/):
  The application consists of a static main method.
- [example02](http://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/blob/master/jekrun/deployment/example02/):
  The application consists of a Swing frame.
- [example03](http://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/blob/master/jekrun/deployment/example03/):
  The application consists of a Swing applet.
- [example04](http://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/blob/master/jekrun/deployment/example04/):
  The application consists of a Java server page.
- [example05](http://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/blob/master/jekrun/deployment/example05/):
  The application consists of a graphical user interface that communicates with the Java server page.
- [example06](http://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/blob/master/jekrun/deployment/example06/):
   The application consists of a graphical user interface that communicates with a JDBC database.
