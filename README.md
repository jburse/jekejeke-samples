# What is this?

This repostory contains Prolog text samples for Jekejeke
Prolog. Here and then you might see other artefacts
such as Java code, SQL code, XML documents, etc...

The samples are organized along the main components of
Jekejeke Prolog. We thus find samples for the Runtime Library,
the Development Enviroment and the Minlog Extension.
