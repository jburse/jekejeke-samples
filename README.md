# What is this?

This repostory contains mainly Prolog text samples for
Jekejeke Prolog. Here and then you might see other artefacts
such as Java code, SQL code, XML code, etc...

The samples are organized along the main components of
Jekejeke Prolog. We thus find samples for the Runtime Library,
the Development Enviroment and the Minlog Extension.

# Runtime Library Samples

The following samples have already been uploaded.
- [jekrun/benchmark](https://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/tree/master/jekrun/benchmark):
  Benchmark ISO Performance.
- [jekrun/benchdist](https://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/tree/master/jekrun/benchdist):
  Benchmark Module "distributed".
- [jekrun/reference](https://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/tree/master/jekrun/reference):
  Tutorial for the Language Reference.
- [jekrun/interface](https://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/tree/master/jekrun/interface):
  Tutorial for the Programming Interface.
