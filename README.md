# What is this?

This repostory contains Prolog text samples for Jekejeke
Prolog. Here and then you might see other artefacts
such as Java code, SQL code, XML documents, etc...

The samples are organized along the main components of Jekejeke
Prolog. We thus find samples for the Runtime Library, the Development
Enviroment, the Minlog Extension and Prolog Packages.

# Prolog Packages

This directory contains our currated Prolog packages:
- [pack](https://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/tree/master/pack/):
  Various Prolog packages Volume Nr. 1.

# System Samples

The following samples have already been uploaded:
- [jekrun](https://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/tree/master/jekrun/):
  Samples for the Runtime Library.
- [jekdev](https://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/tree/master/jekdev/):
  Samples for the Development Environment.
- [jekmin](https://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/tree/master/jekmin/):
  Samples for the Minlog Extension.

 is no warranty for the samples. You might try a pull
request if you find issues, but there is also no service
