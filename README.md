# What is this?

This repostory contains mainly Prolog text samples for
Jekejeke Prolog. Here and then you might see other artefacts
such as Java code, SQL code, XML code, etc...

The samples are organized along the main components of
Jekejeke Prolog. We thus find samples for the Runtime Library,
the Development Enviroment and the Minlog Extension.

# Runtime Library Examples

The following samples have already been uploaded.
- jekrun/benchdist: Benchmark Module "distributed"

# Developent Environment Examples

Nothing yet.

# Minlog Extenion Examples

Nothing yet.

# Issues and Contributing

Feel free to fork for non-commercial attributed use. There
are is no warranty for the samples, you might try a pull
request if you find issues, but there is also no service
agreement. Note also that Jekejeke is a trademark.
