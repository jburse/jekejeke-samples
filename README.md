# What is this?

This repostory contains Prolog text samples for Jekejeke
Prolog. Here and then you might see other artefacts
such as Java code, SQL code, XML documents, etc...

The samples are organized along the main components of
Jekejeke Prolog. We thus find samples for the Runtime Library,
the Development Enviroment, the Minlog Extension and Prolog Packages.

# Prolog Packages

This directory contains our currated Prolog packages. The packages here are dual
packages, means they work for both Jekejeke Prolog and SWI-Prolog.
As dual packages they have also an icon associated.

- [pack](https://github.com/jburse/jekejeke-samples/tree/master/pack/games):
  Various Prolog packages Volume Nr. 1.

# Issues and Contributing

Feel free to fork for non-commercial attributed use. There
 is no warranty for the samples. You might try a pull
request if you find issues, but there is also no service
agreement by us. Note also that Jekejeke is a trademark.
