# What is this?

This repostory contains Prolog text samples for Jekejeke
Minlog Extension. Here and then you might see other artefacts
such as Java code, SQL code, XML documents, etc...

The samples are organized along the different aspects Jekejeke Prolog.
We thus find samples which are test cases for compliance, or samples
that are from some tutorials or samples that perform some benchmark.
